# SE-Course-Capstone
Capstone project


Initial ideas:

Top choice
1. An application to find recipes based on which ingredients you enter. 
- Using an external API, we can get recipes based on ingredients entered.
- The idea is to get recipes based on what you have available in your kitchen.
- Search for recipes whether you are logged in or not.
- When logged in, you can save your favorite recipes.

Second choice
2. An application to find movie recommendations based on several search filters. 
- Using an external API, we can get movies based on search criteria entered.
- The idea is to get movie results that bring you to a new selection of movies.
- Search for movies whether you are logged in or not.
- When logged in, you can save your favorite movies.

Third choice
3. A webpage to search for datasheets based on either search filters or by a specific part number.
- Similar to https://toolsearch.exsysautomation.com/default/index/en, but with far less data in the database.
- Custom database would be necessary to create.
- Simple single page site with a login to save your selected datasheets.
